## Chapter 1: Matter in Our Surroundings

### Introduction
This chapter introduces the concept of matter, its physical nature, characteristics, states, and how matter can change its state under varying temperature and pressure conditions.

### Subtopics

1. **What is Matter?**
   - Anything that has mass and occupies space is called matter.
   - Examples of matter: air, water, ice, wood, iron, sand, etc.

2. **Physical Nature of Matter**
   - Matter is made up of small particles.
   - Particles of matter are very small — too tiny to be seen with the naked eye.
   - Evidence of particle nature: diffusion, dissolution of sugar or salt in water.

3. **Characteristics of Particles of Matter**
   - Particles of matter have space between them (inter-particle space).
   - Particles of matter move continuously (inter-particle motion).
   - Particles of matter attract each other (inter-particle forces).
   - The strength of these forces varies in solids, liquids, and gases.

4. **States of Matter**
   - Matter exists mainly in three states: solid, liquid, and gas.
   - The state of matter depends on the arrangement, movement, and attraction between particles.

5. **Solid State**
   - Solids have a fixed shape and definite volume.
   - Particles are tightly packed with very little space between them.
   - Particles can only vibrate in their fixed positions.
   - Force of attraction between particles is very strong.
   - Solids are incompressible and have high density.
   - Examples: ice, iron, wood, etc.

6. **Liquid State**
   - Liquids have a fixed volume but no fixed shape.
   - They take the shape of the container in which they are placed.
   - Particles are less closely packed compared to solids.
   - Particles can move/slide past one another.
   - Force of attraction between particles is moderate.
   - Liquids are almost incompressible but have lower density than solids.
   - Examples: water, milk, oil, etc.

7. **Gaseous State**
   - Gases have neither fixed shape nor fixed volume.
   - Particles are far apart and move freely and randomly.
   - Force of attraction between particles is very weak.
   - Gases can be compressed easily and have very low density.
   - Examples: air, oxygen, carbon dioxide, etc.

8. **Comparison Between States of Matter**
   - Solids: strong attraction, fixed shape and volume, least compressible.
   - Liquids: moderate attraction, fixed volume but no fixed shape.
   - Gases: weak attraction, neither fixed shape nor fixed volume, highly compressible.

9. **Can Matter Change Its State?**
   - Matter can change from one state to another by changing temperature or pressure.
   - Examples: Ice melts into water, water boils to form steam, steam condenses to form water again.

10. **Effect of Change of Temperature**
    - On heating, particles gain energy, move faster, and overcome forces of attraction.
    - Solid changes into liquid (melting/fusion).
    - Liquid changes into gas (boiling/vaporisation).
    - On cooling, the reverse happens: gas → liquid (condensation), liquid → solid (freezing).

11. **Melting Point and Boiling Point**
    - Melting Point: The temperature at which a solid changes into a liquid at atmospheric pressure (e.g., ice melts at 0°C).
    - Boiling Point: The temperature at which a liquid changes into vapour at atmospheric pressure (e.g., water boils at 100°C).

12. **Effect of Change of Pressure**
    - Increasing pressure can bring particles closer together, converting gases into liquids.
    - Example: LPG and CNG are stored as liquids under high pressure.
    - Decreasing pressure can convert liquids into gases.

13. **Latent Heat**
    - Latent heat is the amount of heat energy required to change the state of a substance without changing its temperature.
    - Latent Heat of Fusion: Heat required to convert 1 kg of solid into liquid at its melting point.
    - Latent Heat of Vaporisation: Heat required to convert 1 kg of liquid into vapour at its boiling point.

14. **Evaporation**
    - Evaporation is the process by which a liquid changes into vapour at any temperature below its boiling point.
    - It occurs at the surface of the liquid.
    - It is a slow process compared to boiling.

15. **Factors Affecting Evaporation**
    - Surface Area: Larger surface area → faster evaporation.
    - Temperature: Higher temperature → faster evaporation.
    - Humidity: Higher humidity → slower evaporation.
    - Wind Speed: Higher wind speed → faster evaporation.

16. **Cooling by Evaporation**
    - During evaporation, particles absorb energy from surroundings, causing cooling.
    - Examples: Cooling of water in earthen pots, feeling cool after sweating, acetone (nail polish remover) on skin.

17. **Sublimation**
    - Sublimation is the process in which a solid changes directly into vapour without becoming liquid.
    - Examples: camphor, naphthalene, dry ice (solid CO2).

18. **Interconversion of States of Matter**
    - Matter can be changed from one state to another by changing temperature or pressure.
    - Solid ⇌ Liquid ⇌ Gas.
    - This process is reversible.

19. **Important Terms and Definitions**
    - Fusion: Melting of solid to liquid.
    - Freezing: Solidification of liquid to solid.
    - Boiling: Rapid vaporisation throughout the liquid.
    - Condensation: Conversion of vapour into liquid.
    - Sublimation: Direct conversion between solid and gas.

20. **Summary**
    - Matter is composed of tiny particles with space, motion, and attraction.
    - Exists mainly in three states: solid, liquid, and gas.
    - States of matter are interconvertible through changes in temperature or pressure.
    - Evaporation causes cooling.
    - Latent heat plays a key role in state change.
