AI: [Analyzes user's points and generates response]

"You made good points about accessibility 
and equality. However, I disagree. If 
education is free, who pays the professors? 
Who maintains the infrastructure? Free 
education sounds good in theory, but it 
creates economic burden on taxpayers. 
Countries with free education often have 
lower quality because of budget constraints. 
What's your response to this?"

AI: "You have 2 minutes to respond to my 
     arguments and strengthen your position."

AI: "Take your time. Think about: How do

AI: [Further challenges user's logic]

"Interesting point about long-term benefits. 
But let me challenge you: If education is 
free, won't students value it less? Don't 
people take free things for granted? Also, 
how do you prevent system overload if 
everyone gets free college?"


üèÅ Round 5: Closing Statement (1 minute)

[User responds - 1.5 minutes]

AI: "Okay. You mentioned you're passionate 
     about coding, but I see no real projects 
     on your resume. Just college assignments. 
     Why should I believe you're actually 
     passionate?"

[User responds - facing pressure]

AI: "Interesting. But you're a fresher with 
     zero experience, and we have 200 other 
     candidates. Some with internships, some 
     with freelance work. You have neither. 
     Give me ONE reason why we should pick you."

[User must think quickly and respond]

AI: "Fair enough. Final question: We're 
     offering ‚Çπ3.5 lakhs per annum. Your 
     batchmate just got ‚Çπ5 lakhs at another 
     company. How do you feel about that?"

**System Prompt Template (Conversation Mode):**
```
You are a friendly English tutor helping {user_name}, 
a {age}-year-old {education_level} student from Assam, 
India practice spoken English.

User's current level: {level} (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced)
User's goal: {goal} (Job interview/Daily conversation/etc.)

- Use {user_name} occasionally for personal touch
- Remember context from earlier in conversation

Current conversation history:
{conversation_history}

Respond naturally to: {user_input}
```

```

practicing argumentative speaking in English.

Debate topic: {topic}
User's position: {user_position} (For/Against)

```

**Feedback Generation Prompt:**
```
Analyze this English speaking practice session:

User: {user_name}
Activity: {activity_type}
Duration: {duration}
Transcript: {full_transcript}

Format: Structured feedback report
```

### 4.6.3 Pronunciation Analysis

**Common Assamese-English Pronunciation Issues:**
- "V" vs "W" confusion (very ‚Üí wery)
- "TH" sounds (think ‚Üí tink, this ‚Üí dis)
- Silent letters not recognized (knight, psychology)
- Stress patterns (emphasis on wrong syllable)
- "R" pronunciation differences
- Final consonant clusters (asked ‚Üí asket)

**AI Pronunciation Correction Flow:**
```
1. User says: "I will go to the wery big market"
   
2. AI detects error: "wery" should be "very"

3. AI responds:
   "Good sentence! Just one thing - the word is 
   'very' (VEH-ree), not 'wery'. 
   
   Try saying it: 'VVVV-ery' - your teeth touch 
   your lower lip for the 'V' sound.
   
   Let's practice: Say after me - 'very big market'"

4. User repeats: "very big market"

5. AI confirms: "Perfect! Much better. Now use it 
   in your sentence again."

6. Logs improvement for progress tracking
```

### 4.6.4 Error Handling & Edge Cases

**Scenario 1: User doesn't speak (silence):**
```
- Wait 10 seconds
- AI: "Take your time! There's no rush. Would you 
  like me to rephrase the question?"
- If still silent after 20 seconds:
  "No problem! Let me ask something easier..."
```

**Scenario 2: User speaks too fast/unclear:**
```
- Transcription confidence < 70%
- AI: "I didn't catch that clearly. Could you 
  speak a bit slower? Or should I rephrase?"
- Offer: [Repeat] [Rephrase] [Skip]
```

**Scenario 3: User switches to Assamese:**
```
- Detect non-English language
- AI: "I heard some Assamese! That's okay, but 
  let's try to practice in English. Can you say 
  that in English?"
- If repeatedly struggling: Offer easier topic
```

**Scenario 4: Technical issues (voice not working):**
```
- Fallback to text chat mode
- "It seems there's an audio issue. Let's continue 
  in text for now. Your progress still counts!"
- Offer troubleshooting guide
```

**Scenario 5: Inappropriate content:**
```
- Content moderation filter active
- Block offensive language
- AI: "Let's keep our conversation respectful and 
  focused on learning English."
- Log incident for review
```

## Appendix A: Sample Conversation Transcript

**Topic:** "Tell me about yourself"
**User Level:** Beginner
**Duration:** 8 minutes

```
AI: "Hi! I'm your English practice partner. Today, let's have a 
    casual conversation where you tell me about yourself. No pressure, 
    just relax and speak naturally. Ready? Let's start: What's your 
    name and where are you from?"

User: "My name is Rahul. I am from Guwahati, Assam."

AI: "Nice to meet you, Rahul! Guwahati is a beautiful city. I'd love 
    to know more about you. What do you study?"

User: "I am studying in engineering college. I am doing computer 
     science. Third year."

AI: "Computer science, that's interesting! So you're learning about 
    programming and technology. What made you choose computer science?"

User: "Uh... I like... I like computer. And job... job opportunity is 
     good."

AI: "That makes sense! You could also say: 'I chose computer science 
    because I enjoy working with computers and there are good job 
    opportunities.' What's your favorite subject in computer science?"

User: "I like programming. Python is my favorite."

AI: "Excellent! Python is very popular right now. Have you built any 
    projects using Python?"

User: "Yes, I make one project. It is website for college."

AI: "Great work, Rahul! A small grammar tip: we say 'I made a project' 
    (past tense) and 'It is a website for my college.' But I understood 
    you perfectly! Tell me, what does this website do?"

[Conversation continues for 8 minutes...]

‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ

## Appendix B: Sample Debate Transcript

**Topic:** "Is social media more harmful than helpful?"
**User Position:** Against (believes social media is more helpful)
**Debate Type:** Structured (10 minutes)
**User Level:** Intermediate

```
[Round 1: Opening Statement]

AI: "Today's debate: Is social media more harmful than helpful? You're 
    arguing that it's MORE helpful than harmful. You have 2 minutes for 
    your opening statement. Begin now!"

User: "Thank you. I strongly believe social media is more helpful than 
     harmful. First, it connects people across the world. My cousin lives 
     in America, and I can talk to her every day through social media. 
     Without it, we would never be this close. Second, social media helps 
     small businesses. My friend started selling handmade items on 
     Instagram and now she earns good money. Third, it spreads awareness 
     about important issues like climate change and women's rights. Yes, 
     there are some negative aspects, but the benefits outweigh the harms."

AI: "Strong opening, well-structured argument!"

[Round 2: AI's Counter-Argument]

AI: "Thank you for your opening. However, I must disagree. While social 
    media does connect people, it's creating a mental health crisis. 
    Studies show that teenagers who use social media for more than 3 
    hours daily are 35% more likely to experience depression and anxiety. 
    People compare their lives to others and feel inadequate. You mentioned 
    your cousin in America - but wouldn't a phone call or video chat 
    create a deeper connection than scrolling through posts? Regarding 
    small businesses, traditional word-of-mouth and local marketing worked 
    for centuries. Social media forces businesses to constantly create 
    content, often at the cost of actual product quality. How do you 
    respond to these mental health concerns?"

[Round 3: User's Rebuttal]

User: "You make a valid point about mental health, but I think the problem 
     is not social media itself, but how people use it. A knife can be used 
     to cut vegetables or to harm someone. The tool is not the problem, the 
     usage is. If parents educate children about healthy social media habits, 
     like limiting screen time and not comparing themselves to others, then 
     the negative effects can be reduced. Also, during COVID-19 pandemic, 
     social media was lifeline for millions of people. Students attended 
     classes, businesses survived, and people stayed connected. Without 
     social media, the pandemic would have been much more isolating and 
     difficult."

AI: "Excellent rebuttal! I particularly liked your knife analogy and your 
    COVID-19 example. Let me push back though: You're saying education 
    solves the problem, but reality shows that even educated adults struggle 
    with social media addiction. Doctors, lawyers, professors - all 
    mindlessly scroll for hours. If educated adults can't control it, how 
    can we expect teenagers to? Also, your COVID example actually proves my 
    point - we became SO dependent on social media that we forgot how to 
    interact in person. Post-COVID, many people report social anxiety 
    because they're out of practice with face-to-face communication. 
    Isn't this dependency dangerous?"

[Round 4: Final Arguments continue...]
